				<p>The Web is made of HTML pages connected by URLs.</P>
				<p>HTML: HyperText markup language.
				<br>
				Text content: what you see.
				<br>
				Markup: what it looks like.
				<br>
				Reference to other documents: eg images or videos.</P>

				<p>A TAG is contained in angled brackets, and in HTML we have an opening TAG and a closing TAG.</P>
				<p>A void TAG is a TAG that does not require a closing TAG.</P>
				<p>An Element is the opening and closing TAGs and the content between them.</P>
				<p>Attributes are Tags that include some "value" or reference to a website or an image or etc.</P>
				<p>Container elements: elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside of them.</P>

					<p>HTML and CSS develop and change over time, but the underlying principles always remain the same.</p>
					<p>We can think of an HTML file like we think of a house:</P>
					<p>- HTML is the structure of the house like where the walls are placed, the rooms, kitchen.. Etc.
					<br>
					- CSS is the style of the house like the decoration, the colors of the walls.. Etc.
					<br>
					- JAVAScript attached are the interactive components, like the garage door opener, the remote control.. Etc.</P>

					<br><img class="image" src="TheHouse.Gif" alt="this is an image" style="re">
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="Section2">
				<p>DOM: Document Object Model. a tree like structure.</p>
				<p>The browser builds a Tree like structure of the page. And the Tree means a branching structure.</P>
				<p>Sideway triangles are an html element, each has an open and closing tag, and it can include a text or another element/branch.</p>
				<p>To mark the box so you can remember what it's for, and to add style is to give each element a class attribute. A box can also belong to multiple classes.</P>
			</div>
			<div class="Section3">
				Boxifying: dividing/cutting the webpage into boxes within boxes. This is how the browser sees HTML.

			<h2 class="chapter_Title">Notes on Chapter Three</h2>
			<div class="Section1">
				<div>
					<p>The HTML document starts with !DOCTYPE HTML to tell the browser that this is an HTML document.</p>
					<p>Then the HTML starts with html and ends with /html.</p>
					<p>After the HTML TAG we add the head /head Tag.</p>
					<p>Inside the head Tag we add the link to the CSS file.</p>
					<p>After the head Tag we add the body /body Tag.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><img class="image" src="HTML.Gif" alt="this is an image" style="re"></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="Section2">
				<p>The Concept of Cascading: Rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also their child elements, except if the child element has its own rule.</p>
				<p>The Concept of Inheritance: Mechanism by which properties are applied not only to specific element but also to its descendants, inheritance relies on the document tree/hierarchy. Only text related properties are inherited, Box related properties are not inherited.</p>
				<p>The Box Model: Margin; Border; Padding; Content.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="Section3">
				<p>It is very important in computer programming not to  REPEAT YOURSELF - Avoid repetition.</p>
				<p><b>CSS</b> assist programmers to avoid repetition.</p>
				<p>Repeated codes are very hard to maintain.</p>
				<p>Writing your style inline with your HTML is not a very good idea because it leads to a lot of repeated codes and you will need to modify the code in every individual element if you decided to make a change or fix an error.</p>
